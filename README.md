# CousinRicky’s POV-Ray Tools

This “repository” is simply an index to my POV-Ray-related tools. My [Object Collection modules are listed in a separate index](https://github.com/CousinRicky/POV-Ray-Object-Collection), so those are not listed here.

## Code

- [SpectralRender modifications](https://github.com/CousinRicky/POV-SpectralRender-mods) - Gamut mapping is added, and the composer file does not need to be edited with each project.

## Tutorials

- [IsoBevelTut](https://github.com/CousinRicky/IsoBevelTut) - Beveled text isosurfaces
