# CousinRicky’s POV-Ray Tools Index

This “repository” is simply an index to my [POV-Ray](https://www.povray.org/)-related tools. My [Object Collection modules are listed in a separate index](https://github.com/CousinRicky/POV-Ray-Object-Collection), so those are not listed here.

## Include Files

- [Radiosity-Pretrace](https://github.com/CousinRicky/POV-Radiosity-Pretrace) - A tool to set the pretrace parameters for POV-Ray radiosity
- [RC3-POV-Tools](https://github.com/CousinRicky/RC3-POV-Tools) - Miscellaneous POV-Ray include files
- [SpectralRender modifications](https://github.com/CousinRicky/POV-SpectralRender-mods) - Gamut mapping is added, and the composer file does not need to be edited with each project.

## Tutorials

- [IsoBevelTut](https://github.com/CousinRicky/IsoBevelTut) - Beveled text isosurfaces
- [POV-Spherical_Law_of_Cosines](https://github.com/CousinRicky/POV-Spherical_Law_of_Cosines) - Spherical Law of Cosines
